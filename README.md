# GitHub Repo Gallery Project

This project users four API calls to GitHub to pull user information - username, bio, location, and number of public repositories - as well as the title of each public repo and corresponding data, including the repo name, its description, languages used, and topics included.

The individual repos are displayed in two columns. Clicking on a repo will display information about it. The user can also search by name for a repo using dynamic search functionality.
